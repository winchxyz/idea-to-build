## Versioning policy

- **Major** (1.x.x → 2.0.0): breaking changes to core methodology or sub-agent contracts
- **Minor** (x.1.x → x.2.0): new profiles, new sub-agents, new distribution channels
- **Patch** (x.x.1 → x.x.2): prompt refinements, doc fixes, anti-pattern additions

## Template update protocol

When the core methodology changes:

1. **Do not** silently edit `core/CLAUDE.md` or sub-agent prompts
2. Add a CHANGELOG entry describing what changed and why
3. Bump the version in the relevant files
4. Document migration path for users on older versions
5. Test against 2–3 example brainstorms before release
